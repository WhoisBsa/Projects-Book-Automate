# Welcome

Mad Libs is a program that reads text files and allows the user to add their own texts in any place where the word *ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB* or *VERB* appears in the text file.

For example, a text file might look like this:

    The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. 
    A nearby NOUN was unaffected by these events.

The program finds these occurrences and prompts 
the user to replace them:

    Enter an adjective: silly
    
    Enter a noun: chandelier
    
    Enter a verb: screamed
    
    Enter a noun: pickup truck

The following text is created:

    The silly panda walked to the chandelier and then screamed. 
    A nearby pickup truck was unaffected by these events.

The result is displayed on the screen and saved in a new text file with a user input asking which name he wants to save the file.
